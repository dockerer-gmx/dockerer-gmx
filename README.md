## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a hobby software engineer.
- I like using https://www.docker.com/ for packaging/distributing as well as testing/developing my own software/scripts/application and configurations.
- I created this GitHub Profile to collect all my docker-related public repositories.

- Check out my main Repository under https://github.com/dockerer-gmx/hub.docker.com
